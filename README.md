# Southwest-Scraper

This is a scraper for Southwest Airlines Tickets.

As of now, this is an unfinished project. 

The goal is to scrape the first six rows of future flights data between each Southwest Airport (as of Dec. 2021). The data should include the following - 

-FLight Number
-Departure Airport
-Destination Airport
-Flight Duration
-Number of Stops
-Where are the stops
-Layover Time
-ticket prices (business, economy+, economy)

The data will either be generated as a JSON object per each Airport OR directly imported into supabase. I haven't decided yet.
